I thrive on the art of storytelling and am known for my approachable nature. To me, every narrative, whether it unfolds in life or data, begins with a rich backstory waiting to be explored. And what better way to unravel these tales than through the lens of SQL and statistics?

My journey into Business Intelligence (BI) Analysis ignited my passion for SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power BI. Through various projects, I've tackled real-world business challenges, using data to drive innovation and optimize outcomes.

In my professional experience, I've developed a versatile skill set through extensive collaboration, where clear communication plays a pivotal role in successful teamwork. I find great satisfaction in supporting colleagues and recognize that effective collaboration fuels collective success.

With expertise in big data analysis and visualization, I'm eager to contribute to the BI sphere. My goal is to foster growth and enhance performance through strategic insights and innovative approaches.

Outside of work, I enjoy diving into animation projects or video editing, turning passion into a fulfilling hobby. When I'm not glued to screens, I cherish quality time outdoors with friends and loved ones—often accompanied by my wiener dog, except when we're off to Disneyland.

Let's connect to share insights and explore potential synergies for mutual advancement!</p>
